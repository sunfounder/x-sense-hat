For Python User
================

Here we just show you the effect of this example implementation. You can go directly to the Examples page of Ezblock Studio to see the full codes and run them.

The examples are from simple to complex and it is recommended to run them in order.

-----------------

Here we will draw a funny character and show a heart on the screen.

Display Temperature
----------------------

At this time the X Sense HAT is a thermometer to display the current temperature. You can also check the current temperature remotely on your device.

Sound Effect
--------------

X Sense Hat can make voice. You can type text to make it speak, or make specific sound effects. 
Let us fire a gun as soon as a 3s countdown stops.

Music Player
--------------

In this example, the X Sense HAT acts as a Music Player, the up and down buttons of the joystick to control the volume of the Music Player and the left and right buttons to control the pause or play of the music.


Point Line Rectangle Circle
------------------------------

By creating a coordinate we can draw a point, a line, a rectangle and a circle at the  specified location on the X Sense HAT.

Calibrate the MPU9250
-----------------------

The InvenSense MPU9250 is a System in Package (SiP) that combines two chips: the MPU-6500 three-axis Accelerometer and three-axis Gyroscope; and the AK8963 three-axis Magnetometer. 

Before using the MPU9250 chip, we need to calibrate different chips.

Coordinate System of MPU9250
------------------------------

The figure below is the coordinate system used by MPU9250.

**Calibrate Accelerometer and Gyroscope**

After running the code, place the X Sense HAT horizontally, turn the A switch on and turn it off after 2 seconds, then the calibration is complete.

The X Sense HAT records the current horizontal position as a 0 degree point on the different axes of the Accelerometer and Gyroscope.

**Calibrate Magnetometer**

Turn the B switch on（keep switch A off）, rotate the X Sense HAT clockwise around the **y-axis** by 720° and then rotate it back (also 720°), please control the speed so that the process takes about 15s.

.. image:: img/tip35.jpg
  :width: 600
  :align: center

Similarly, rotate the X Sense HAT clockwise around the **x-axis** by 720° and then rotate it back (also 720°), please control the speed so that the process takes about 15s.

.. image:: img/tip36.jpg
  :width: 600
  :align: center

Finally, rotate the X Sense HAT clockwise around the **z-axis** by 720° and then rotate it back (also 720°), please control the speed so that the process takes about 15s.

Turn off switch B to complete the calibration.

Read from MPU9250
--------------------

After calibrating the MPU9250 chip, let's print the data read by the MPU9250 chip.

The following diagram shows the coordinate system for the Acelerometer and Gyroscope.

.. image:: img/tip41.png

  :align: center

.. note::

  Note the positive direction on each axis.

**Accelerometer**


Through the Accelerometer, we can read the acceleration values of the X Sense HAT on the different axes in **g**.

Place the X Sense HAT horizontally. At this time, the X Sense HAT will be subjected to a vertical downward acceleration of gravity, which is **g (g=9.80665 N/kg)**.

.. image:: img/tip42.jpg
  :width: 600
  :align: center

When we print the acceleration value on the z-axis, the Debug Monitor will display a value around -1. Since the acceleration value is on the negative half axis of the z-axis, the unit is negative.

.. code-block:: python

    def forever():
        print("%s"%(imu.read("accel","z")))
        delay(100)

Rotate the X Sense HAT clockwise around the y-axis. At this time, the gravitational acceleration received by the X Sense HAT can be decomposed into an acceleration on the x-axis and
an acceleration on the z-axis, we can print these 2 accelerations on the Debug Monitor.
        
.. code-block:: python

    def forever():
        print("%s"%('-----------------'))
        print("%s"%(imu.read("accel","x")))
        print("%s"%(imu.read("accel","z")))
        delay(100)

        Gyroscope
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Gyroscope**

Through the Gyroscope, we can read the angular velocity values ​​of X Sense HAT on different coordinate axes, the unit size is degrees/second.

The judgment of the unit symbol follows the right-hand spiral rule. Hold the axis with your right hand and the thumb points in the direction of the positive semi-axis.

At this time, the direction pointed by the four fingers is the positive direction of the angular velocity value.

.. image:: img/tip64.jpg
  :width: 600
  :align: center

Print the angular velocity value on the y-axis.

.. code-block:: python

    def forever():
        print("%s"%(imu.read("gyro","y")))
        delay(100)

Rotate the X Sense HAT clockwise around the y-axis. Because the angle of the X Sense HAT changes, the angular velocity value of the y-axis is generated and will be printed on Debug Monitor.
According to the right-hand screw rule, its unit is positive.

**Magnetometer**
    
The following diagram shows the coordinate system for the Magnetometer.。
  
.. image:: img/tip56.jpg
  :width: 400
  :align: center

.. note::

  Note the positive direction on each axis.

Through the magnetometer, we can read the magnetic field strength of X Sense HAT on different coordinate axes, the unit size is 15μT.

We can put a magnet on the positive x-axis of the X Sense HAT.

.. image:: img/tip66.jpg
  :width: 400
  :align: center

Then print the value of the magnetic field strength on the positive semi-axis of the x-axis (in positive unit).

.. code-block:: python

    def forever():
        print("%s"%(imu.read("mag","x")))
        delay(100)

Know the Direction
--------------------

Now we make the X Sense HAT into a compass so that we don't get lost.

The green arrow indicates the detect direction of X Sense HAT, you can use it to judge the current position.

**Azimuth Bearing**
  
Azimuth Bearing refers to the number on the outer circle and the Azimuth is the angle from the north direction line to the target direction line in a clockwise direction.
For example, 0 degrees is the direction of true north, and 30 degrees is the direction of 30° east by north.

.. image:: img/tip47.png
  :width: 400
  :align: center

.. code-block:: python

  def forever():
    print("%s"%(imu.magnetic_angle('azimuth')))
    delay(100)

**Quadrant Bearing**
    
Quadrant Bearing divides the direction of the compass into eight equal parts. For example, the NE direction is between 22.5 degrees and 67.5 degrees.
And between 67.5 degrees and 112.5 degrees is the E direction.

.. image:: img/tip68.jpg
  :width: 500
  :align: center

.. code-block:: python

  def forever():
    print("%s"%(imu.magnetic_angle('quadrant')))
    delay(100)

Attitude Angle
-----------------

X Sense HAT能计算当前位置的姿态角，这样我们就能判断X Sense HAT的平衡状态。

这是适用于计算姿态角的坐标系，注意不同轴的正半轴的方向，这对我们判断旋转角度的方向会有帮助。

.. image:: img/tip56.jpg
  :width: 400
  :align: center

姿态角单位符号的判定同样遵循右手螺旋定则，将右手握住x轴，
大拇指指向x轴正半轴的方向，此时四根手指指向的方向就是roll角的正方向。
同理我们用右手握住y轴，将大拇指指向y轴正半轴的方向，此时四根手指指向的方向就是pitch角的正方向。

.. image:: img/tip57.jpg

下载当前代码，水平放置时，打印窗口将显示0。
我们将X Sense HAT沿着x轴顺时针旋转30度，此时打印窗口将显示30。

.. image:: img/tip70.jpg
  :width: 400
  :align: center

修改代码内容，然后重新下载。

.. code-block:: python

  def forever():
    print("%s"%(imu.get_posture_angle(aram = "pitch")))
    delay(100)

水平放置时，打印窗口仍然显示0。我们将X Sense HAT沿着y逆时针旋转30度，此时打印窗口将显示-30。

Make Gif
-----------

Draw multiple independent actions on the dot matrix screen. After the code runs, you can see a GIF animation.

Spirit Level
---------------

Make X Sense HAT a spirit level. By reading the changes in roll angle and pitch angle, we can know whether the X Sense HAT is level.

Gravity Ball Game
-------------------

Next, we have a gravity ball game on X Sense HAT. After pressing the joystick, the game starts. You need to keep the ball in the middle, if the ball hits the edge, the game is over.

Compass
----------

We make X Sense HAT into a compass. Draw a circle on the RGB dot matrix, and then use the green dot to indicate the current direction, and the red dot to indicate the true north direction.


Smart Sense HAT
-------------------

We integrate the functions of X Sense HAT into a menu interface, press and hold the arrow keys of the joystick to select different functions, and press the joystick to execute the current function.
